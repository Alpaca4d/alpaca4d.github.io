# ðŸ“‰ Analysis

**Alpaca4d** is a software tool for performing various types of structural analysis. It can perform several different types of analyses, including:

1. Linear static analysis: This type of analysis is used to determine the static response of a structure to a known set of loads. The results show the deflection, stress, and strain at various points in the structure.
2. Linear dynamic analysis: This type of analysis is used to study the dynamic response of a structure to dynamic loads such as earthquakes or wind. It can be used to calculate the response spectrum, mode shapes, and frequencies of a structure.
3. Nonlinear static analysis: This type of analysis is used to study the behavior of a structure when it is subject to large deformations. It is often used to investigate the behavior of structures under extreme loading conditions, such as collapse or failure.
4. Nonlinear dynamic analysis: This type of analysis combines the principles of linear and nonlinear static analysis to study the behavior of a structure under dynamic loads that cause large deformations.
5. Pushover analysis: This type of analysis is used to determine the nonlinear static response of a structure to a monotonic lateral load. It is commonly used to assess the seismic performance of structures.
