# ðŸ’¾ Assemble

The concept of assembling a finite element model involves creating a digital representation of a physical object or system. This is done by dividing the model into smaller, manageable pieces called elements and defining their properties, such as material stiffness. The model is then connected by a mesh of nodes and elements to represent the interactions between the pieces. The model is then solved mathematically to represent the behavior of the system under specified loads and boundary conditions.
