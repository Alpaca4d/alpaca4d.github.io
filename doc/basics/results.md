The result outputs are created with the use of **MPCO** recorder developed by [ASDEA Software Technology](https://asdeasoft.net/?product-stko).

The **MPCO** recorder in **OpenSees** is a tool that allows users to record the values of response parameters during a simulation and to extract these values for post-processing and analysis. The **MPCO** recorder can be used to record the response of a structure at various points during the simulation, such as the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of specific nodes. This information can be used to study the behavior of a structure over time, to evaluate the effectiveness of different control strategies, or to analyze the response of a structure under different loading conditions.
