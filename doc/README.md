description: Alpaca4d - OpenSees wrapper for Grasshopper
---

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

**Alpaca4d** is a Grasshopper plugin which has been developed on top of [**OpenSees**](https://opensees.berkeley.edu/). It lets you analyse beam, shell and brick elements through Static, Modal and Ground Motion Analysis.

Alpaca4D is currently developed by [**Marco Pellegrino**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mp0110/) and previously helped by Domenico Gaudioso.

**Alpaca4d** facilitates the interaction with OpenSees making it possible to model complex geometries within your parametric workflow and reducing the time spent in the modelling. The main idea of **Alpaca4d** is to provide an efficient and easy way to use **OpenSees** without writing any line of code. The library is mostly used by researchers and academia because of the not user-friendly interface even if the math at the core library is highly sophisticated.

The belief is to bring more users to perform structural analyses with Opensees in a parametric environment such as Grasshopper.

**Disclaimer**\
The author cannot be held responsible for the output and it should therefore always be used in combination with another finite element analysis package for validation and documentation.
