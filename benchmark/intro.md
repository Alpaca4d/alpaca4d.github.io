# 🧑‍🌾 Introduction

By using benchmarks to evaluate the performance of a structural engineering API, developers can ensure that their software is accurate, efficient, and capable of handling a wide range of complex calculations. This not only helps to ensure that the API is reliable and robust, but also helps to inspire confidence among engineers and other professionals who rely on it to design and analyze structures.
