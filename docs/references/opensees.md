# ðŸŒŠ OpenSees

OpenSees is an open-source software platform for simulating the behavior of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquakes and other forms of dynamic loading.

It can be used by engineers, researchers, and students to perform nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures and soils. OpenSees provides a convenient and efficient interface for formulating, solving, and visualizing the results of complex dynamic models, and it supports a wide range of modeling approaches and numerical methods.
