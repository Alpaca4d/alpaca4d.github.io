# ðŸ’£ Loads

Alpaca4d supports the implementation of various types of loads that can be applied to the elements of the structure. The load elements available in Alpaca4d are gravity load, point load, beam load and shell Load.

Gravity load represents the weight of the structure and is applied as a uniform load on each element in the vertical direction. Point load is a concentrated load applied at a specific point on the structure. Beam load can be applied as a uniform, linear, or trapezoidal load along the length of a beam element. Shell load is a surface load applied to shell elements, such as roofs and walls, in the form of pressure, bending, or shear.

In Alpaca4d, the magnitude and direction of each load element can be specified, and the software will calculate the resulting deformations and internal forces in the structure. The loads can also be time-dependent, allowing for dynamic analysis of structures subject to earthquakes or wind.

In conclusion, Alpaca4d provides a comprehensive set of load elements that enable the simulation of a wide range of structural loading scenarios. The ease of implementation and versatility of these load elements make Alpaca4d a valuable tool for structural engineers and researchers.
